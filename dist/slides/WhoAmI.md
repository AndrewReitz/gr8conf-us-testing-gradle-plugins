Note:
First off. I'm Andrew Reitz. I am a Android Developer at The Nerdery. Which is
an custom design and development shop. Probably the most important thing to know
about me at least in the context of this talk is that I am the maintainer of
the groovy android gradle plugin, which just hit 1.0 last month btw. Working on
this plugin is where I got the idea for this talk. And lastly you can find
me on twitter and github at these places.

Also, a huge shout out the the ratpack and gradle team. I've learned a great
deal from looking through the source code of both of these projects.

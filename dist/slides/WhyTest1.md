# Why Test?

![Fail Cat](image/whytest_fail.gif)

So this doesn't happen to you.

Note:
So I don't want to spend a lot of time in this area because I'm sure we have all
been told that we should test, and there are many talks on why. But my main
reason is to make sure I don't break anything in the future. I want to know
that any time I make an update to the code the project either works as before
or if it's not code I write it works as expected.
